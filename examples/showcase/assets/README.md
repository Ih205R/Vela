# Assets Directory

Place your Logo2.png file in this directory.

The Vela showcase site is configured to display the logo in the hero section with:

- Alt text: "Vela Language Logo"
- Dimensions: 200x200 pixels

## Adding Your Logo

1. Copy your Logo2.png file to this directory
2. Make sure it's named exactly "Logo2.png"
3. Rebuild your site with `npm run build` or `npm run dev`

The image will appear at the top of the showcase site's hero section.
